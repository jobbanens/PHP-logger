# PHP-logger
A simple PHP script that logs the IP and other user info in a .log file

This script should be placed inside the page you want to log (be sure the page has the .php extension. Ex: index.php)

Made with PHP version 7.2

Make sure you deny/disallow access to files with the .log extension via the Apache or Nginx config. Otherwise people can access it.
This is not an entirely safe way of storing data. This script should NOT be used for storing sensitive data!
